## 🛠️ Admin Setup Required

### 1. Add Sample Products
You'll need to create products through the admin interface or directly in the database. Here's a sample product setup:

```sql
-- Sample: The Bomber Overdrive
INSERT INTO products (
  id, name, slug, description, shortDescription, brandId, sku, basePrice,
  isActive, isFeatured, powerRequirements, compatibility, createdAt, updatedAt
) VALUES (
  'bomber-overdrive',
  'The Bomber Overdrive',
  'bomber-overdrive',
  'The Bomber Overdrive hits that perfect spot between subtle breakup and serious distortion...',
  'Premium overdrive pedal with vintage warmth and modern clarity',
  'brand-m2labs',
  'M2L-BOMBER-001',
  24900, -- $249.00 in cents
  true,
  true,
  '9V DC, 2.1mm center negative, 50mA',
  'Works with all guitars and amplifiers',
  datetime('now'),
  datetime('now')
);

-- Default variant
INSERT INTO product_variants (
  id, productId, name, sku, price, isDefault, trackInventory, 
  requiresShipping, taxable, createdAt, updatedAt
) VALUES (
  'bomber-overdrive-default',
  'bomber-overdrive',
  'Standard',
  'M2L-BOMBER-001-STD',
  24900,
  true,
  true,
  true,
  true,
  datetime('now'),
  datetime('now')
);

-- Product image
INSERT INTO product_images (
  id, productId, url, altText, position, isMainImage, createdAt
) VALUES (
  'bomber-image-1',
  'bomber-overdrive',
  '/images/M2-Labs-The-Bomber-Overdrive-1.jpg',
  'The Bomber Overdrive pedal',
  0,
  true,
  datetime('now')
);

-- Category assignment
INSERT INTO product_category_relations (productId, categoryId)
VALUES ('bomber-overdrive', 'cat-overdrive');

-- Initial inventory
INSERT INTO inventory_items (
  id, variantId, locationId, quantity, lowStockThreshold, updatedAt
) VALUES (
  'inv-bomber-main',
  'bomber-overdrive-default',
  'main-warehouse',
  50,
  5,
  datetime('now')
);
```

### 2. Admin Shop Management
Navigate to `/admin` and you'll find shop management options. The interface needs to be built for:

- ✅ **Products**: Add/edit products and variants
- ✅ **Inventory**: Manage stock levels
- ✅ **Orders**: View and process orders
- ⚠️ **Coupons**: Create discount codes (basic structure ready)
- ⚠️ **Analytics**: Sales and performance metrics (basic structure ready)

2. **Checkout** → Creates Stripe Payment Intent
3. **Payment** → Stripe processes payment
4. **Confirmation** → Order created, inventory updated
5. **Webhooks** → Handle payment status updates

## 📧 Email Service Setup (Optional)

For order confirmations and notifications:

### Option 1: Resend (Recommended)
```bash
npm install resend
```
