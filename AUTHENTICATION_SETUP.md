# M2 Labs Authentication System - Complete Setup Guide

## Overview

A comprehensive authentication system has been implemented for M2 Labs with Ecwid Single Sign-On (SSO) integration. This system provides secure user management, customer accounts, and admin tools for managing your guitar pedal business.

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 🔐 Core Authentication System
- **JWT-based authentication** with secure HTTP-only cookies
- **Password hashing** using bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **User registration and login** with proper validation
- **Secure session management** with 7-day token expiration
- **Role-based access control** (customer/admin roles)

### 👤 Customer Experience
- **Registration page** (`/register`) with comprehensive form validation
- **Login page** (`/login`) with proper error handling
- **Customer dashboard** (`/account`) with intuitive navigation
- **Profile management** (`/account/profile`) for updating personal information
- **Order history** (`/account/orders`) to view purchase history
- **Warranty claims** (`/account/warranty`) for submitting and tracking warranty requests

### 🛒 Ecwid Integration
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration for seamless shopping experience
- **Automatic customer login** when shopping on the integrated store
- **Enhanced shop page** (`/shop`) with Ecwid storefront embedding
- **JWT token generation** specifically for Ecwid authentication
- **Ready for Ecwid configuration** with clear setup instructions

### 🔧 Admin Panel Enhancements
- **User management** (`/admin/users`) to view and manage customer accounts
- **Warranty claim management** (`/admin/warranty`) to handle warranty requests
- **Dashboard statistics** showing user and claim metrics
- **Secure admin authentication** with role verification
- **Enhanced navigation** with new management sections

### 🎨 UI/UX Improvements
- **Updated header navigation** showing authentication status
- **Mobile-responsive** authentication forms and dashboards
- **Modern design** consistent with M2 Labs branding
- **Loading states** and error handling throughout
- **Intuitive navigation** between account sections

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file with these variables:

```bash
# Authentication
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-super-secret-nextauth-key-change-this-in-production
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Ecwid Configuration
ECWID_STORE_ID=your-ecwid-store-id
ECWID_PUBLIC_TOKEN=your-ecwid-public-token
ECWID_SECRET_TOKEN=your-ecwid-secret-token

# Email Configuration (for future password reset features)
SMTP_HOST=your-smtp-host
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-smtp-user
SMTP_PASS=your-smtp-password
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@m2labs.com

# Site Configuration
SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
SITE_NAME=M2 Labs
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

The required dependencies have been added to `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔧 Complete Ecwid Setup Guide

### Step 1: Create Ecwid Account
1. **Sign up** at [ecwid.com](https://ecwid.com)
2. **Choose a plan** (Free plan works for testing, paid plans for production)
3. **Complete store setup** wizard

### Step 2: Get Your Ecwid Credentials
1. **Store ID**: 
   - Go to Ecwid Admin → Settings → General
   - Your Store ID is displayed at the top (e.g., "123456789")
   
2. **API Tokens**:
   - Go to Ecwid Admin → Apps → My Apps → API section
   - **Public Token**: Click "Create" for read-only public access
   - **Secret Token**: Click "Create" for private API access (used for SSO)

### Step 3: Update Your Code Files

**File: `/src/app/shop/page.tsx`**
Replace line 34:
```javascript
// FROM:
script.src = 'https://app.ecwid.com/script.js?shop_id=YOUR_SHOP_ID';

// TO:
script.src = 'https://app.ecwid.com/script.js?shop_id=YOUR_ACTUAL_STORE_ID';
```

**File: `.env.local`** (create if it doesn't exist)
```bash
# Ecwid Configuration
ECWID_STORE_ID=your-actual-store-id-here
ECWID_PUBLIC_TOKEN=public_your-public-token-here
ECWID_SECRET_TOKEN=secret_your-secret-token-here
```

### Step 4: Configure Ecwid SSO (Single Sign-On)

**In your Ecwid Admin Panel:**

1. **Go to Settings → Security**
2. **Enable "Custom customer accounts"**
3. **Set Customer account URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/login`
4. **Set Customer sign-up URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/register`
5. **Enable "Single Sign-On (SSO)"**
6. **Set SSO endpoint**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/ecwid/sso`
7. **Save settings**

### Step 5: Database Configuration Options

The system currently uses a simple file-based database in the `data/` folder. Choose one option:

#### Option A: Keep File-Based Database (Easiest)
- **Perfect for testing and small-scale deployment**
- **Files created automatically** in `data/` folder:
  - `users.json` - Customer accounts
  - `orders.json` - Order history
  - `warranty-claims.json` - Warranty claims
- **No additional setup required**

#### Option B: Migrate to Real Database (Recommended for Production)
**For PostgreSQL:**
```bash
npm install pg @types/pg
```
Update `src/libs/database.ts` to use PostgreSQL instead of JSON files.

**For MongoDB:**
```bash
npm install mongodb
```
Update `src/libs/database.ts` to use MongoDB instead of JSON files.

### Step 6: Webhook Configuration (Optional but Recommended)

**Set up Ecwid webhooks** to sync orders automatically:

1. **In Ecwid Admin** → Apps → My Apps → Webhooks
2. **Create webhook** for "Order paid"
3. **Endpoint URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/api/ecwid/webhook`
4. **Create the webhook handler** (file to create):

**File: `src/app/api/ecwid/webhook/route.ts`**
```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { createOrder } from '@/libs/database';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const webhookData = await request.json();
    
    if (webhookData.eventType === 'order.paid') {
      // Sync order to your database
      const order = {
        userId: webhookData.data.customerId,
        ecwidOrderId: webhookData.data.orderNumber,
        status: 'processing',
        total: webhookData.data.total,
        currency: webhookData.data.currency,
        items: webhookData.data.items,
        shippingAddress: webhookData.data.shippingAddress,
        billingAddress: webhookData.data.billingAddress
      };
      
      await createOrder(order);
    }
    
    return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
  } catch (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Webhook failed' }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```
