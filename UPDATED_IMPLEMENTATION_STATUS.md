## 🔧 **CURRENT LIMITATIONS**

1. **Product Data**: No products in database yet - you'll need to add them via SQL or admin interface
2. **Admin UIs**: Backend APIs work but admin interfaces need to be built
3. **Email**: Order confirmations ready but email service needs configuration

## 💡 **Quick Start for Testing**

1. **Add Sample Product** (SQL):
```sql
-- Add to your D1 database to test
INSERT INTO products (id, name, slug, brandId, sku, basePrice, isActive, isFeatured, createdAt, updatedAt) 
VALUES ('test-product', 'Test Pedal', 'test-pedal', 'brand-m2labs', 'TEST-001', 29900, true, true, datetime('now'), datetime('now'));

INSERT INTO product_variants (id, productId, name, sku, isDefault, createdAt, updatedAt)
VALUES ('test-variant', 'test-product', 'Standard', 'TEST-001-STD', true, datetime('now'), datetime('now'));
```

2. **Test Customer Flow**:
   - Visit `/shop` → see products
   - Click product → view details
   - Add to cart → checkout
   - Complete purchase

3. **Setup Stripe**:
   - Add your Stripe keys to environment variables
   - Test with Stripe test cards
